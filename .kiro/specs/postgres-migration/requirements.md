# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the AI Shopping Assistant backend from in-memory data storage to a PostgreSQL database. Currently, the application stores user credits, credit transactions, user consent records, and query cache data in memory, which is not suitable for production use as data is lost on application restart and cannot scale across multiple instances.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want user credit data to persist across application restarts, so that users don't lose their credit balances when the service is redeployed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application restarts THEN user credit balances SHALL be preserved from before the restart
2. WHEN a user checks their credit balance THEN the system SHALL retrieve the data from PostgreSQL database
3. WHEN credits are deducted or reset THEN the changes SHALL be persisted to PostgreSQL database
4. WHEN credit transactions are logged THEN they SHALL be stored in PostgreSQL database

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want user consent records to be stored persistently, so that user privacy preferences are maintained across service restarts and comply with data protection regulations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides consent THEN the consent record SHALL be stored in PostgreSQL database
2. WHEN the application restarts THEN user consent records SHALL remain accessible
3. WHEN consent is updated THEN the changes SHALL be persisted to PostgreSQL database
4. WHEN consent records are queried THEN they SHALL be retrieved from PostgreSQL database

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the query cache to optionally use PostgreSQL for persistence, so that cached results can be shared across multiple application instances and survive restarts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a query result is cached THEN it SHALL be stored in PostgreSQL database with expiration timestamp
2. WHEN retrieving cached results THEN expired entries SHALL be automatically filtered out
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL be able to use existing cached results from PostgreSQL
4. WHEN cache cleanup runs THEN expired entries SHALL be removed from PostgreSQL database

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database migrations to be handled automatically, so that schema changes can be deployed safely without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL automatically run pending database migrations
2. WHEN database schema changes are needed THEN migration scripts SHALL be created and versioned
3. WHEN migrations fail THEN the application SHALL not start and SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN rolling back deployments THEN database migrations SHALL support rollback operations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want database connection pooling and error handling, so that the application can handle database connectivity issues gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database connections are needed THEN they SHALL be managed through a connection pool
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
3. WHEN the database is temporarily unavailable THEN the application SHALL continue to function with degraded capabilities where possible
4. WHEN database errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate detail for debugging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the existing service interfaces to remain unchanged, so that the migration to PostgreSQL doesn't require changes to other parts of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are migrated to PostgreSQL THEN their public interfaces SHALL remain the same
2. WHEN existing tests are run THEN they SHALL continue to pass without modification
3. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL function identically to the in-memory implementation
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN no changes SHALL be required in frontend code
